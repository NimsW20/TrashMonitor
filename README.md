# TrashMonitor
'TrashMonitor,' a digital electronic device for waste management. Our team - Me, Lahiru Cooray, Senum Dodangoda and Thaveesha Wathudura - developed a system that measures bin waste levels using electronic sensors, updates a real-time cloud database via WiFi, and displays bin locations and fill levels on a map using an Android app. TrashMonitor is powered using Li-ion batteries that are recharged by a solar panel. TrashMonitor not only enhances efficiency for trash collectors in urban areas but has wide applications in, factories, farms, and hotels.
